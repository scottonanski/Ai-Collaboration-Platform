## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key(s)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scottonanski/Ai-Collaboration-Platform.git
   cd Ai-Collaboration-Platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API keys:
   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY_WORKER1=your_openai_api_key_here
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY_WORKER2=your_second_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   
   > **Note**: You can use the same API key for both workers if needed.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in your browser**
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, you'll need to set up the environment variables on your hosting platform. The following environment variables are required:

```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY_WORKER1=your_production_openai_key_1
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY_WORKER2=your_production_openai_key_2
```

#### Building for Production

1. Create a production build:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   # or
   npm run build
   ```

2. The production files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

3. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or a traditional web server).

> **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore` by default.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Project Type:** AI-Powered Multi-Agent Collaboration Platform  
**Current State:** Advanced Prototype with Mixed Implementation Status  
**Architecture:** React/TypeScript Frontend + FastAPI Backend + OpenAI Integration

## 🎯 What This Project Is

It's a sophisticated **AI collaboration orchestration platform** that enables multiple AI agents (workers) to collaborate on complex tasks through structured dialogue and iteration.

**Core Concept:** Two AI workers with different roles (e.g., Developer & Analyst) collaborate in turns to solve problems, with a human moderator able to inject guidance and pause/resume the collaboration.

## 💡 **Strategic Recommendations**

1. **Rebrand Project Identity:** The current README misrepresents the project. This is an **AI Collaboration Platform**, not primarily a code editor.

2. **Focus on Core Strength:** The AI collaboration engine is the most valuable and unique feature - prioritize enhancing this.

3. **Simplify Initial Scope:** Remove non-essential features (file system, code execution) to focus on perfecting AI collaboration.

4. **Add Real Use Cases:** Develop specific collaboration templates (code review, design planning, problem-solving).

5. **Improve User Experience:** Add guided onboarding and collaboration templates for new users.
